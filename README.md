- 👋 Hi, I’m @aloha-laura
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the depth of **engineering craftsmanship**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning design patterns in order to master them
- 💞️ **I love sharing knowledge** — I regularly speak at tech conferences (especially around **Angular** and architecture) and write blog posts from time to time about tech, team culture, and product thinking.  
- 🎒 Outside of work, I’m also a **summer camp director**, passionate about **team dynamics, leadership, and collective energy** — values I bring into every tech team I work with.
