## Welcome

- 👋 Hi, I’m @aloha-laura
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the depth of engineering craftsmanship
- 🌱 I’m currently learning design patterns in order to master them
- 💞️ I love sharing knowledge — I regularly speak at tech conferences (especially around Angular and architecture) and write blog posts from time to time about tech, team culture, and product thinking.  
- 🎒 Outside of work, I’m also a summer camp director, passionate about team dynamics, leadership, and collective energy — values I bring into every tech team I work with.
